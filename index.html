    <p>This is my new friend Willow she is a <strong>Sugar Glider</strong>. A sugar glider is related to kangaroos and koalas. She is similar to flying squirrels but she is not related to them. She loves to climb, eat, and sleep. Willow is about 2 and a half months old. I adopted her about 2 weeks ago and she has been a load of fun!The only thing that can be annoying is that she lives in my room and she is a nocturnal <em>animal</em>.</p>
